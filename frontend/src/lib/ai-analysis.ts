‚Ä¢ **450GB of new data** was added to the production-logs bucket
‚Ä¢ **120GB of duplicate files** were uploaded across multiple buckets
‚Ä¢ **Data transfer costs** increased by 35% due to more cross-region replication

**Recommendations:**
1. Enable S3 Intelligent Tiering to automatically optimize storage costs
2. Implement lifecycle policies to delete old logs after 90 days
3. Review and deduplicate files in production-logs bucket

This should reduce your S3 costs by approximately $240/month.`;

‚Ä¢ us-west-2: $1,450 (34%) - 5 instances  
‚Ä¢ eu-west-1: $700 (17%) - 3 instances

**Key Findings:**
‚Ä¢ 3 new m5.xlarge instances were launched 5 days ago in us-east-1, increasing costs by 42%
‚Ä¢ All production instances run 24/7 with ~70% utilization
‚Ä¢ Development instances also run 24/7 with only ~15% utilization during off-hours

**Optimization Opportunities:**
1. Purchase Reserved Instances for production workloads ‚Üí Save ~$18,500/year
2. Implement auto-shutdown for dev instances during off-hours ‚Üí Save ~$5,400/year
3. Consider Graviton instances for 20% better price-performance`;

**Quick Wins (Low effort, Low risk):**
1. üí∞ **$18,560/year** - Purchase EC2 Reserved Instances
2. üí∞ **$3,240/year** - Enable S3 Intelligent Tiering  
3. üí∞ **$2,880/year** - Delete 12 unattached EBS volumes

**Medium Effort:**
4. üí∞ **$7,200/year** - Right-size over-provisioned RDS instance
5. üí∞ **$5,400/year** - Auto-shutdown dev environments off-hours
6. üí∞ **$1,890/year** - Optimize CloudFront caching

I recommend starting with #1, #2, and #3 which can be implemented quickly and will give you $24,680 in annual savings with minimal risk.`;

**Key Drivers:**
‚Ä¢ EC2 costs increasing due to 3 new instances launched recently
‚Ä¢ Linear growth pattern suggests continued expansion
‚Ä¢ Seasonal traffic patterns indicate 8-12% increase in Q4

**Confidence Level:** 85%

**Risk Factors:**
‚ö†Ô∏è If the recent EC2 growth continues, costs could reach $14,200  
‚ö†Ô∏è Without optimization, monthly costs will exceed $15,000 by end of quarter

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Implement cost controls and budgets alerts at $13,000
2. Review and approve the recommended optimizations to offset growth
3. Set up auto-scaling policies to prevent unnecessary resource expansion`;
